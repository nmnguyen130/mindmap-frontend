- [ ] AI service integration and rate limiting
- [ ] Design system and component specifications
- [ ] Expo Application Services (EAS) account setup

## Blockers
- None currently

## Development Notes
- **Zustand Best Practices**: Use immer for complex mutations, persist critical state, enable devtools
- **TanStack Query Patterns**: Implement optimistic updates, proper error boundaries, background refetching
- **Platform Detection**: Use Platform.OS and Platform.select() consistently
- **Testing Strategy**: Test on real devices, use Expo Go for rapid iteration

## Performance Targets
- **Web**: Lighthouse score >90, bundle size <500KB
- **Mobile**: App startup <2s, memory usage <100MB
- **Cross-platform**: 95%+ code sharing, consistent 60fps animations

## Notes
- Prioritize Zustand over complex state management solutions
- Leverage TanStack Query for all server state
- Test frequently on both platforms during development
- Use Expo's built-in features whenever possible for better compatibility
